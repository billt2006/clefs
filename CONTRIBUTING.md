# Contributing to clefs

If you'd like to submit an issue, do it!  Don't be shy!

If you want to add a plugin, feel free to submit it as a pr or to publish your
own in your own repo.  If you'd like to do that, you could also send me a pr to
add something to the docs in the monorepo to make it more discoverable.

Don't be a jerk.
